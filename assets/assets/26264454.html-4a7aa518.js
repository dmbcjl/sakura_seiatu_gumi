When Shoya&#39;s actions are finally condemned by the principal, all of his friends and teachers turn against him, socially isolating him well into high school to the point that he eventually considers suicide, which he believes would absolve him of his bad deeds. To make amends, he reunites with Shoko, who is still lonely due to her shyness. Realizing that both are suffering due to his past sins, Shoya sets out on a path of redemption by trying to reconnect Shoko with their old classmates that Shoko never had the chance to befriend back then, including Shoya&#39;s former comrade, Naoka Ueno, who holds a grudge against Shoko for &quot;causing&quot; Shoya&#39;s isolation; Miki Kawai, their narcissistic former class president; and Miyoko Sahara, a kind girl who was the only one attempting to befriend Shoko years before. They also make new friends in Tomohiro Nagatsuka, a similarly friendless fat boy who owes Shoya; and Satoshi Mashiba, Miki&#39;s crush.</p><p>The seven begin to work together when Tomohiro&#39;s plan to create a film for a competition, which he plans to only include Shoya and himself, attracts the attention of Naoka, Miki, Tomohiro and Satoshi, with Shoya additionally inviting Shoko to join the project. While filming, the seven face their personal challenges and conflicts. Shoko eventually tries to confess her love to Shoya, but it does not get through to him and ends up in a misunderstanding. The group also has a falling out when Shoya tries to isolate himself again by insulting the crew, leading to Shoko feeling sorry for him. As she believes she is the sole reason for the parting of the group, Shoko attempts to kill herself and is rescued by Shoya, who gets badly hurt in the process, falling into a coma. This impacts the other six of the group as they start to resolve their problems while suspending the project until Shoya awakens. Once he recovers, Shoya reconciles with his film crew and finally completes the film, which, while a failure, has greatly helped him and his friends.</p><p>A year after their high school graduation and their subsequent parting ways, the seven reunite for the Coming of Age Day. By then, Shoya has stopped ignoring the people around him and now has a lot of friends.[2] At the end of the Age Day, Shoya and Shoko are seen going into their elementary school reunion together holding hands so that Shoko will feel less nervous.</p><h3 id="production-company" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#production-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Production company</h3><p>Kyoto Animation</p><h3 id="time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#time" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Time</h3><p>2016-09-17<code>JP</code></p><h3 id="episodes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#episodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Episodes</h3><h3 id="imdb" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#imdb" aria-hidden="true">#</a> IMDB</h3><p><code>tt5323662</code></p>',12),u={id:"more26264454-md",tabindex:"-1"},g=t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#more26264454-md","aria-hidden":"true"},"#",-1),y=o('<h4 id="comment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment</h4><h4 id="sentence" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentence" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sentence</h4><ul><li>The cherry blossoms are perishable, but the spring trees are evergreen.
