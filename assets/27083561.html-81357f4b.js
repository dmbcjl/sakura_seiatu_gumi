They age much slower than humans, and can live for hundreds of years. They are legendary to outsiders, who have dubbed them the &quot;Clan of the Separated&quot;.</p><p>Maquia, a young, orphaned Iorph girl, serves as an assistant to the clan&#39;s chief, Racine, who warns her about creating emotional attachments to outsiders, saying that Maquia will know what true loneliness is if she does. Soon afterward, the neighboring kingdom of Mezarte sends armed soldiers on the backs of flying dragons called Renato to the Iorph village. Unable to find the secret to their longevity, the army attacks, killing most of the Iorph and kidnapping Leilia, Maquia&#39;s friend. One of the Renato succumbs to the &quot;Red Eye&quot; disease and goes berserk during the attack. It becomes tangled in Hibiol, and flees the village, inadvertently carrying Maquia, who is tangled in the fabric. The Renato later crashes and dies in a forest. Maquia wakes up and meets an alcoholic merchant at the ambushed caravan, where she finds a newborn baby boy, held tightly in the arms of his deceased mother. Refusing to let him die, she pulls the baby from the woman&#39;s arms and takes him in as her son. She travels to the village of Helm, where a woman, Mido, takes them in, raising them alongside her two sons, Lang and Deol. Maquia names her adopted son Ariel.</p><p>Time passes and Ariel has grown into a child. The Kingdom of Mezarte had once built their strength and reputation on their ownership of the ancient Renato, but the Renato have started to succumb to the &quot;Red Eye&quot; disease, leaving them with less than ten as they begin to die out. Fearing the inevitable loss of power and influence, the king of Mezarte tries to claim ownership of another ancient and legendary power, the Iorph&#39;s longevity, leading him to attempt to introduce Iorph blood into the royal bloodline. Through a message woven into a Hibiol Maquia finds in a shop, she discovers that Leilia has been forced into an arranged marriage with the prince of Mezarte. She travels on a ship with Ariel to try to free Leilia. On the ship, she meets Krim, an Iorph. He is a friend of hers from their homeland, who was Leilia&#39;s former boyfriend and Maquia&#39;s secret crush. Krim is also seeking to free Leilia. Once in the capital of Mezarte, the two meet with a number of other Iorph, and unsuccessfully ambush a royal parade. Maquia briefly frees Leilia, but learns that Leilia is pregnant with the prince&#39;s child. Maquia flees on Leilia&#39;s orders and avoids capture with the help of the merchant, revealed to be half-Iorph. Krim, undeterred, resolves to continue trying to free Leilia, and leaves Maquia and Ariel behind.</p><p>As more time passes, Maquia and Ariel move to the iron-forge city of Dorail, where Maquia works as a restaurant waitress. Ariel grows to be a teenage forge worker. He becomes alienated from Maquia by the ever-decreasing difference in their apparent ages. Meanwhile, Leilia, still in the palace, is a prisoner of the royals. She has been cast aside because her daughter Medmel shows no signs of being an Iorph. She has not been able to meet Medmel ever since her birth, leaving her in despair. One day, Ariel and Maquia happen to meet Lang, now a soldier in Mezarte&#39;s army. Their meeting pushes Ariel and Maquia farther apart, allowing Ariel to join the army of Mezarte. Moments after he leaves, Maquia is kidnapped by Krim.</p><p>Approximately ten years later, Ariel has returned to the capital and married Dita, a girl he knew in Helm. She is pregnant with their first child. Meanwhile, Krim has gathered the support of the surrounding nations to invade and overthrow Mezarte. He takes a still-captive Maquia with him, trying to reach the palace in the battle. They are separated in a forest outside the capital, and after a brief encounter with Ariel, Maquia goes to the town and finds Dita in labor. She helps deliver the baby, while Ariel continues to fight and is wounded in the battle. Maquia finds Ariel and they share a heartfelt conversation before she offers him an emotional goodbye, and then she heads to the palace. Elsewhere, after finally finding Leilia in the palace and being rejected in favor of Medmel, Krim tries to kill both her and himself, but Krim is ambushed and killed by the chief of the guards. As the battle ends with Mezarte&#39;s loss, Ariel returns home and meets his newborn daughter. Maquia takes the last living Renato and flies away with Leilia, who manages to reunite briefly with Medmel before departing.</p><p>Many years later, Maquia returns to the village of Helm once again with the half-Iorph merchant, finding Ariel as an old man on his deathbed, and holds his hand as he dies. Leaving their home, she shoulders the pain of her loss, crying as she remembers the moments of her life she spent with him. Maquia rejoins the merchant and continues on the road, remarking to herself, despite the profound pain of loss, that loving her son brought her happiness.</p><p>A post-credit image shows the Iorph village being reinhabited once again by the surviving Iorph and their descendants, along with the last Renato.</p><h3 id="production-company" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#production-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Production company</h3><p>P.A.Works</p><h3 id="time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#time" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Time</h3><p>2018-02-24<code>JP</code></p><h3 id="episodes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#episodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Episodes</h3><h3 id="imdb" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#imdb" aria-hidden="true">#</a> IMDB</h3><p><code>tt7339826</code></p>',16),c=e('<h2 id="more" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More</h2><h4 id="comment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment</h4><h4 id="sentence" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentence" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sentence</h4><ul><li>God why did you teach me how to open the cage</li></ul><h2 id="other" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Other</h2><h3 id="watch-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#watch-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Watch［1］</h3><ul><li>2023-02-05</li></ul><h3 id="repeat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#repeat" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Repeat</h3>',8);function p(u,f){const t=i("FixedImage"),n=i("ppfp");return h(),o("div",null,[d,a(t,{url:"/assets/anime/27083561.jpg"}),l,a(n,{ppfp:[2,2,3,1]}),c])}const g=r(s,[["render",p],["__file","27083561.html.vue"]]);export{g as default};
