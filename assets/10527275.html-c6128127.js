In this era, all humans possess powerful psychic abilities and live an idyllic life in agrarian villages. Despite her parents&#39; fears that she may not awaken her powers, Saki gains her special powers at the age of twelve and joins her friends—Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano—in Sage Academy, a special school for psychics. However, the children are unaware that the village government is monitoring and evaluating students through the education system. Based on these evaluations, certain students are removed from society because of reasons such as poor performance (such as with Reiko) or for cheating. The memories of the removed students are erased from the community; Saki and her remaining friends have no memory of Reiko and other students. During an unsupervised camping field trip, Saki and her friends capture a False Minoshiro, a mythical animal revealed to be an ancient library robot. The False Minoshiro explains the violent truth of how the current era came about and what their special powers truly are.</p><p>While interrogating the False Minoshiro, Saki and her friends are found by the monk Rijin. He destroys the False Minoshiro and seemingly seals away the children&#39;s special powers for associating with a demon. On the way back to be judged at the village, Rijin is killed by a rogue Queerat tribe while Saki and Satoru are separated from their friends. They are captured by the rogue Queerat colony. Using objects found during their trip, Saki and Satoru are able to escape their prison. During their escape, they meet a Queerat, Squealer, of the Robber Fly colony who rescues them from their pursuers. Saki and Satoru help Squealer and his colony to defeat the rogue Queerats, later with assistance from General Kiroumaru and his Giant Hornet colony, a colony with an especially close relationship to humans. After regrouping with their friends with the help of Squealer and general Kiroumaru, Saki restores their powers, using the same hypnotic methods the village uses to control children, before returning to the village under the belief that the adults do not know of their transgressions.</p><h4 id="part-iii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#part-iii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Part III</h4><p>Two years later, as Saki and her friends reach adolescence and develop relationships, Shun starts to distance himself from the others and eventually goes missing. Saki finds Shun in an abandoned house and learns that he has become a Karmic Demon and had been sent to die in isolation. After holding himself back for the duration of their meeting, Shun tells Saki to go while telling her the adults know of their transgressions two years ago before using his powers to take his own life. Soon after, unlike with Reiko, Saki and her remaining friends start to realize Shun&#39;s absence despite being unable to fully remember him. In time, Saki learns that the survival of herself and her friends has been orchestrated by the Education board and the Ethics Committee Head Tomiko Asahina, who sees Saki as a potential successor. Later, Mamoru and Maria run away after the Education Board tries to purge Mamoru. Squealer, renamed by the humans as Yakomaru as a reward for his usefulness, helps them by staging their deaths. However, after finding the Robber Fly queen lobotomized and that Yakomaru acquired a False Minoshiro, Saki begins to have dreams of a faceless child that tells her not to find Mamoru and Maria as they must die.</p><h4 id="part-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#part-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Part II</h4><p>Now 26 years old, Saki works for the village government in the &quot;Department of Mutant Management&quot; which oversees the Queerats. Yakomaru&#39;s colony slowly ascends to power while conquering other colonies and wiping out the Giant Hornet colony, eventually attacking Kamisu 66 with what is believed to be a Fiend that the Queerats refer to as their &quot;Messiah.&quot; This is later revealed to be the biological child of Mamoru and Maria who Yakomaru raised after murdering the parents. After evading the Fiend and learning that Yakomaru intends to steal more human infants to create an army to wipe out the human race, Saki and Satoru are joined by Kiroumaru who guides them to the ruins of Tokyo to find the &quot;Psychobuster&quot;; an anthrax-like anti-psychic weapon. With Yakomaru&#39;s forces surrounding them, Satoru attempts to kill the Messiah with the Psychobuster, but Saki destroys the weapon because its use at such close proximity would also have killed Satoru. Saki realizes that the Messiah is not truly a Fiend, but actually a regular psychic like themselves, with one key difference: the Messiah considers Queerats as his kin which is what enables him to bypass the Death Feedback when attacking other humans. With seemingly no options left, Saki and Satoru plead with Kiroumaru for help. After admitting his own disdain towards humans and their treatment of his kind, Kiroumaru agrees to help, but asks for his colony to be spared the humans&#39; retaliation once the revolt is ended. He disguises himself as a human and attacks the Messiah. The Messiah kills Kiroumaru, but upon realizing that Kiroumaru is a type of Queerat, dies due to Death Feedback.</p><p>With the Messiah dead and his rebellion crushed Squealer is defeated. Renouncing the name the humans gave him, Squealer is sentenced to perpetual torture of the &quot;Infinite Hell&quot; where his body is simultaneously regenerated and destroyed using psychic powers. However, Saki is troubled when Squealer explains the reasons behind his revolt, claiming that his people are human. Later, Saki learns from Satoru that the Queerats are the descendants of normal humans whose DNA had been altered with mole rat genes to make it easier for the psychic humans to control them, since they will not trigger Attack Inhibition and Death Feedback. Now feeling sorry for Squealer, Saki secretly puts him out of his misery.</p><p>In the epilogue ten years later, Saki has married Satoru and they expect their first child. Both are positive that the world will be a better place by the time their child grows up.</p><h3 id="production-company" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#production-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Production company</h3><p>A-1 Pictures</p><h3 id="time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#time" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Time</h3><p>2012-09-28<code>JP</code></p><h3 id="episodes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#episodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Episodes</h3><p>25 episodes</p><h3 id="imdb" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#imdb" aria-hidden="true">#</a> IMDB</h3><p><code>tt2309320</code></p>',23),l=e('<h2 id="more" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More</h2><h4 id="comment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Comment</h4><h4 id="sentence" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentence" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sentence</h4><ul><li>A new order can only be born after being poured with countless blood.</li></ul><h2 id="other" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Other</h2><h3 id="watch-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#watch-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Watch［1］</h3><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">there is a possibility of error</p></div><ul><li>2020-08-21</li></ul><h3 id="repeat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#repeat" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Repeat</h3>',9);function u(c,m){const a=s("ppfp");return r(),o("div",null,[d,n(a,{ppfp:[2,3,2,3]}),l])}const b=i(h,[["render",u],["__file","10527275.html.vue"]]);export{b as default};
